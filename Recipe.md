__Cooking Process:__

1) Preheat the oven to 180 °C (350 °F)

_Caramel_

2) In a saucepan, cook the sugar and water until it is a dark golden brown. 
3) Once this is done, divide it among 6 126 ml (1/2 cup) capacity ramekins and allow to cool.

_Custard_

4) Add the sugar and vanilla extract to the hot milk. Stir until the sugar has dissolved.
5) Beat the eggs in a bowl. Once this is done, whisk them into the milk and sugar and pour the hot mixture into the ramekins.
6) Prepare a water bath by laying a towel in the bottom of large baking dish. Place the ramekins in the dish and fill it halfway up with simmering water.
7) Bake it for about 40 minutes. Make sure the water doesn't boil.
8) After it's cooked, remove it from the oven and the water. Let it cool completely.
9) Refrigerate them for at least 12 hours. It would be best to keep them in the refrigerator overnight. 
10) To serve, run a small knife around the edge of each ramekin to loosen the custard. Quickly invert each custard onto a plate. If it doesn’t release right away, gently shake the ramekin from side to side a few times to help it out.
11) remember to serve it cold.

And that's it! You will have 6 servings of delicious Creme Caramel. Enjoy!
